# pueue_installer

This script is designed to automatically install Pueue on Linux devices. It is important to note that the script will only work on Linux at this time and not on any other operating system. However, it is possible that support for additional operating systems will be added in the future.

To use the script, follow these steps:

Download the script to your device.
1. Set the permissions for the script by running the command: "chmod +x install_pueue.sh".
2. Execute the script by running the command: "./install_pueue.sh".
3. Once the installation is complete, you will be ready to use Pueue on your console.

Please note that if you are using Pueue through ssh, it will end when you exit the console.
